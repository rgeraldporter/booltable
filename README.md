# BoolTable

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/rgeraldporter/booltable.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/rgeraldporter/booltable)

BoolTable is an expressive alternative for complex and incongruous if/else conditional structures in Javascript.

It exposes two APIs: `Truth` and `Decision`. These roughly match up to being truth tables and decision tables.

More info forthcoming soon!
